# Eloquent JavaScript Notes

A collection of my personal notes on the book [Eloquent JavaScript written by Marijn Haverbeke](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

## Reflection

This came from a [LinkedIn article from Raymond Gan on his ideal boot camp](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-ideal-coding-bootcamp-raymond-gan/). I remember him suggesting you summarize chapters for well known programming books like [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) So in the same vein of developers I respect like [Swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) and [Eliot Sanford](https://twitter.com/techieEliot), I am learning in public and sharing my knowledge with the community. 

My goal for each chapter is to distill the most important parts. I will add my own language and custom examples to better understand the why. I will also add my personal questions within chapters and answers that are backed up by research. 

I hope this helps you better understand the power you have to make things with JavaScript.
