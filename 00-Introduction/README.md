## 1. Introduction

```
"We think we are creating the system for our own purposes. We believe we are making it in our own image... 
But the computer is not really like us. It is a projection of a very slim part of ourselves: that portion devoted to logic, order, rule, and clarity."

- Ellen Ullman, Close to the Machine: Technophilia and its Discontents
```

**TLDR:** This book is about instructing computers

Before we move on, we need to ensure we are on the same page with terminology definitions:

* `Programming` is the act of constructing a `program`
* A `program` a set of **precise set of instructions** telling a computer **what to do**

**NOTE:** We use programming because:

1. Computers are brainless (meaning they only do what they are told to do via programs)
2. Computers require you to write very specific instructions or else you receive error messages because the computer cannot complete the code given.

The 2 statements above make the following statement true:

```
Programming can feel laborious and can lead to a lot of frustration
```

**The good news is** if you can get over all that and you can think on the same level as our `brainless` computer, programming can become a productive and gratifying experience.

With your new thinking skills, you can:

* Do things in seconds that would take `forever` by hand.
* Make your computer do things that it could not before
* Continue building your abstract thinking muscle


**Most programming is done with programming languages**

A `programming language` is an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers. 

Like `human languages`, `computer languages` allow words and phrases to be combined in any way imaginable, making it possible to represent new concepts.


## 2. On Programming

This book also introduces the basic principles of programming.

**NOTE:** Programming is hard.

The fundamental rules of programming are simple and clear, but most programs that are built on top of these rules can get more complex and eventually the programmer m.ust add their own rules to deal with their complexity


**TLDR:** Your building your own maze and it is likely you will get lost in it.


There will be times you read this book and get frustrated because it won't entirely make sense to you. **That's okay**. This is a lot of information to digest (similar to trying to drink water from a firehose). If you feel frustrated:

* Stop. Take a break (seriously).
* go over the example programs and exercises.
* Write down what is confusing you in question form and see if you can answer after rereading the chapter.
* Take the question to a community of developers. Find an example you can show so more experienced developers can help you.


A `program` is many things:

* A piece of text typed by a programmer
* The directing force that makes the computer do things
* Data from in the computer's memory
* It controls the actions performed on the computer's memory
